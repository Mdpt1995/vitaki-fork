# Set Up Remote Play on Steam Deck

This section covers how to set up PlayStation Remote Play (using Chiaki) on Steam Deck. It covers installing the `chiaki4deck` package, configuring an automatic (scripted) launch, and adding `chiaki4deck` to _Game Mode_ with icons and a custom controller configuration to boot. Please switch into _Desktop Mode_ for this process.

!!! Tip "Open This Documentation on Your Steam Deck for Easy Copy/Pasting"

    If you open this documentation in a web browser on your Steam Deck (such as using the Firefox flatpak), you can easily copy and paste commands by clicking the copy icon to the right of each command (appears when hovering over the right end of a code box):

    and pasting with ++ctrl+v++ or right-click->paste in regular windows and ++ctrl+shift+v++ or right-click->paste in `konsole` windows.

    !!! Tip "Navigating Desktop Mode"

        This install requires entering into _Desktop Mode_. Please connect the following to your Steam Deck:
        
        === "Highly Recommended"

            - external keyboard (You can use `Steam` + ++x++ to bring up and use the virtual keyboard and make liberal use of copy/paste if you really need to, but it is a much worse experience)

        === "Optional but Recommended if you Have Available"
        
            - external mouse (can use the touchpad/trackpads on the device instead) 
            
            - external monitor (can use the native Steam Deck screen instead)
